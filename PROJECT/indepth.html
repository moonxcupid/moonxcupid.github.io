          <p class="">‘Everything began on June 9.’Sky said. On June 9, the Civil Human Rights Front held the demonstration of ant-extradition law. After that, the movement and the related protests have lasted for 6 months.&nbsp;<br><br>‘You can call me Sky. I’m a year 4 student, studying business.’ Sky looks exactly the same with the other university student. However, he is more than a student. ‘I was the pro-democracy before. 5 years ago, I also joined the Umbrella Movement, but I was just singing and sitting on Admiralty at that time.&nbsp;<br><br>Time flies, human changes. ‘I think I evolved. I will call myself a supporter of Hong Kong independence now because everything happened in this half year told me that peaceful isn’t a solution anymore. 721, 831 and 101, we won't forget these days and we won’t forget the Hong Kong Police.’&nbsp;<br><br>Different stance, different actions. ‘I’m both soft and hard protester. I do the soft things like joining the peaceful demonstration and singing the songs. I also create and stick the promoting materials. Meanwhile, I’m the hard one which means I will join the frontline when the police are fighting with us.’ I would like to ask more about the situation when he was on the frontline, but it is better for him to talk about it less.&nbsp;<br><br>‘I have 6 lesson which is 4 days per week. And I don’t think I participate well in my school work because I think I have only attended 60% of the lesson. However, I have joined the protest since the first protest in June 9. And I think I have joined nearly 80% of the protest.’ It seems Sky is a good protester rather than a good student.&nbsp;<br><br>It is a big question for the student-protester to make a balance between school work and protest. And Sky just can't make it, ‘to be honest, I don’t think I can balance both school work and protest. Like I said before, I only attend 60% of the lesson. Moreover, despite the school time, I spend 80% of rest of the time on protesting.’ Protest is more than protest. ‘I protest, I make the promoting materials and I spread them, I train myself in case the police chase me and I can still escape, and I need to rest too.’ Sky explained. As a result, he spent little time of doing the homework and revision. ‘I just can’t make the balance.’&nbsp;</p>
