          <p class="">Fingertips running on the keyboard, as fast as the footsteps of her finals deadline. Today is the date of submission for two essays and one oral assessment, she has got 10 hours left to finish them all.&nbsp;<br><br>From her outfit to her smile, Jade looks as ordinary as any university students one could imagine. The difference is just that she is a student in Hong Kong, a student under the shadow of the half-year long anti-extradition bill movement. “Our generation has been through a lot. From the Umbrella Revolution five years ago to this moment, nobody would have pictured ourselves fighting against the higher power with such scale and determination. One could say that we are the chosen ones, but it is just something to happen sooner or later, and it just happened to be us who hold the responsibility of protecting our home.”&nbsp;<br><br>Jade would call herself one of the “peaceful, rational and non-violent” characters. Away from the frontline but not away from the protests, Jade has been participating in most of the peaceful events. Every major demonstration, human chains, singing in shopping malls, “lunch with you”, pasting promotional materials etc. She spends three days a week in average on protest related activities. However one only has 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Jade has to use the remaining time to cope with her school work. “I could not manage to attend all the classes because it would be too physically and mentally demanding, how could I go to school everyday like everything is normal while watching all the chaos around me everyday?”&nbsp;<br><br>Skipping Monday lectures had been her routine, as she would be exhausted after huge demonstrations on Sundays. Assignments are another huge problem, and it gets more difficult when it was time for mid-terms. “There were tons of homework in October and tons of protests too. I remember on the 19th I was connecting human chains in Central at night, unfortunately a test was scheduled on the day after. When I managed to get back home it was already 2am, so when I had to wake up at 7 to take the test I knew that it would be a mess.” Luckily, the result was a pass. What is worse is her mental condition, every time she tries to focus on papers, she could not resist checking on her phone about the latest news and pictures of police brutality keeps on catching her mind.&nbsp;<br><br>In order to take a balance, she could only choose to sacrifice her rest time and only sleep for 4 to 5 hours per day. She also started to avoid staying until the crowd has all gone. “I had to take a relatively balanced life because it is my final year, I dont want my gpa to be too pathetic.” Jade smiled helplessly. Still determined to make her contribution in protests, Jade could only try her best to return home earlier and cope with her school work in a rush.&nbsp;<br><br>When asked if she feels tired, Jade only shrug her shoulders, “Well no one knows when would this come to an end, but if everyone do more when they are able to, it certainly helps. I might be tired but I would never rest for too long.” </p>
